# smoothbp 0.2.4

* Removed the experimental `re_fraction` argument (added in 0.2.3 dev,
  never released to CRAN): it performed a binary centred/non-centred
  per-group switch, not the partial non-centring its name implied.
  True per-group partial non-centring is deferred to a future release.
  Use `reparameterise = "omega"` for full non-centring; diagnose with
  fibr's `smoothbp_advisor()`.

# smoothbp 0.2.3

* Fixed severe MCMC convergence issue (low ESS, divergences) in random change-points models by correcting adaptation of subject-level parameters in the NUTS step and introducing a joint Gibbs translation step (`omega_translation_step`) for population-level and subject-level intercepts.

# smoothbp 0.2.2

* Fixed build and installation failures on Fedora Linux and macOS check systems by conditionally skipping compiling and running the Cargo standalone wrapper generation (`document` target) at install time on CRAN.

# smoothbp 0.2.1

* Fixed a build failure on Windows where the offline Rust vendor directory was
  extracted to the wrong location, causing Cargo to be unable to resolve
  `extendr-api` as a dependency during `R CMD INSTALL`.

# smoothbp 0.2.0

* Initial CRAN release.
