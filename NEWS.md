# smoothbp 0.2.2

* Fixed build and installation failures on Fedora Linux and macOS check systems by conditionally skipping compiling and running the Cargo standalone wrapper generation (`document` target) at install time on CRAN.

# smoothbp 0.2.1

* Fixed a build failure on Windows where the offline Rust vendor directory was
  extracted to the wrong location, causing Cargo to be unable to resolve
  `extendr-api` as a dependency during `R CMD INSTALL`.

# smoothbp 0.2.0

* Initial CRAN release.
